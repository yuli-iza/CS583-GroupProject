__Gameplay:__ The end goal for the player in our 3D game is to navigate their character—a penguin—through a course within a given time. We are referencing the game mechanics of Super Monkey Ball while making changes to the overall design and user control/navigation of the course. Our game will have a fatigue attribute to challenge the players ability to complete the course within a given time. It is still unclear on the course we can take with the fatigue attribute, whether it be in reduced speed or reduced visibility of environment/course. Our game course is Arctic themed with ‘icy’ smoother platforms and snowy patches along the course to either impede or support the character movement and navigation through the course within the allotted time. The icy platforms are intended to be harder to “control” the  characters navigation of the course (speed increase, no resistance, slippery) while the snowy can slow down the character either to aid in the player control or to slow them down (helpful but can be used to kill time and increase difficulty). 

**Controls:**
The controls will be mouse and keyboard:
* __Movement:__ Arrow keys or 'WASD' for navigating left, right, up, and down.
* __Collect:__ Navigate Player to collect ‘coins’
* __Menu Navigation:__ Mouse for navigating through menus.

**Art Assets:**
* Penguin character inside a rolling ball
* Various coins with different designs and colors
* Background images for different environments 
* UI elements 
* Animation assets for running, jumping and sliding.
  
**Audio Assets:**
* __Environment:__ If there is a change in platform/environment texture that affects the characters movement we can apply an auditive indicator for this change such as crunching or shuffling through thicker/softer snow.
* __Movement:__ If the characters speed increases or they are going down hill on the course we can apply wind/air sounds.
* __Collection:__ Add small 

**Game Flow:**
- __Main Menu:__ Players can start the game, view controls, choose a player, or exit.
- __Level Selection:__ Players will have one level 
- __Gameplay:__ Players navigate the arctic environment and collect ‘coins’
- __Level Completion:__ Players complete the level upon collecting a certain number of ‘coins’ before the timer runs out or reaches the end of the level.
- __Game Over:__ If the penguin falls or slips off the path the game ends, displaying the score.

**Challenges:**
* Designing different outfits for penguin character in blender
* Creating smooth gameplay for collecting coins, speed increases when going downhill, and a slippery course when the course is icy.
* Ensuring all audio assets match the change in environment, movement, and collection.
* Creating engaging arctic theme level design ensuring smooth gameplay while maintaining a fun interaction.
